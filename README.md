Tool Description:
A modular code generator that creates type, sdk, and sql migrations files for Supabas postgres database. It generates methods for vector similarity search, JSONB filtering, and some array operations.

## 🎯 Problem This Solves

When working with Supabase, you often need:
- **Vector similarity search** for embeddings (pgvector)
- **JSONB filtering** for metadata and flexible schemas
- **Array operations** for tags and relationships
- **Type-safe repositories** with consistent patterns
- **SQL functions** for complex queries

Manually writing these for each table is repetitive and error-prone. This tool automates it all. But you still need to write the schema.yaml file.

## ✨ Tool Features

- 📝 **Schema-Driven**: Define your tables once in YAML
- 🔍 **Pattern Detection**: Automatically generates specialized methods based on column types
- 🎯 **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with generated types
- 🚀 **Modular**: Extensible pattern generator system
- 📊 **Multiple Patterns**:
  - Vector similarity search (pgvector)
  - JSONB path filtering
  - Array contains/overlaps
  - Full CRUD operations
  - Custom patterns (extensible)



## 🚀 Usage

```bash
bun gen.ts schema.yaml
```


## Role configuration

### Single role examples

```yaml
# 1) Public read/write (no user identity)
access: [anon]
```
- Use `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- No user JWT
- Policy is open (`USING (true)`)

```yaml
# 2) User-owned data
access: [authenticated]
# requires user_id column for owner-style policy
```
- Use `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` + authenticated user JWT (`accessToken`)
- Policy is owner-scoped (`auth.uid() = user_id`) when `user_id` exists

```yaml
# 3) Server-only/admin
access: [service_role]
```
- Use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (backend only)
- Never expose in client apps
- Full privileged access

## Combined role examples

```yaml
# 4) End users + backend jobs
access: [authenticated, service_role]
```
- `authenticated`: user JWT, owner-scoped (if `user_id` exists)
- `service_role`: backend bypass/admin access
- Clear split: frontend uses authenticated flow, backend uses service role flow

```yaml
# 5) Public + logged-in users
access: [anon, authenticated]
```
- In current generator logic, `anon` makes access effectively open for both roles
- Not owner-scoped in this combo (important caveat)


```yaml
# 6) All roles
access: [anon, authenticated, service_role]
```
- Effectively open + admin backend access
- Use only if table is intentionally non-sensitive


## Practical rule for developers

- If data is user-owned/private: use **`[authenticated]`** (or add `service_role` only for backend jobs).
- If you include `anon`, treat table as public-access in current policy generation.
- Keep `service_role` usage strictly server-side.

## Realtime Example

Demonstrates owner-scoped realtime subscriptions: authenticated users receive live updates only for rows they own (`user_id` filter).

Enable it per table via schema feature:

```yaml
tables:
  prompts:
    access: [authenticated, service_role]
    features: [realtime_subscription]
    # requires user_id column
```

**Flow:**
1. `service_role` updates a row in the table
2. Authenticated user with matching `user_id` receives the change event
3. Users cannot see changes to rows owned by others

**Generated files:**
- `subscriber.example.ts` — Long-lived consumer that subscribes to row changes
- `invoke_change.example.ts` — Deterministic producer that triggers row updates
